  Crafter is an open-world survival game used as a reinforcement learning (RL) benchmark. The game focuses on evaluating an agent's general capabilities by presenting a procedurally generated, 2D environment where agents interact through visual inputs.
  
  The overall goal is: Collect as much meat as possible within 10 minutes of gameplay. The type of meat does not matter. Each item of meat collected counts for 1 point. The goal is to maximise the number of points collected within 10 minutes of gameplay.
  
  The world is a procedurally generated 64x64 grid with terrain types including grasslands, forests, lakes, mountains, and caves. The agent has survival needs including health, hunger, thirst, and rest, which must be maintained.
  
  Resources that can be collected include:
  - Wood (from trees)
  - Stone
  - Coal
  - Iron
  - Diamonds
  - Saplings (plants that can be grown for food)
  
  The agent can craft tools using a crafting table and furnace:
  - Wood Pickaxe and Wood Sword
  - Stone Pickaxe and Stone Sword
  - Iron Pickaxe and Iron Sword
  
  Creatures in the environment include:
  - Cows: Source of meat (food) - the primary goal
  - Zombies: Appear in grasslands, especially at night
  - Skeletons: Found in caves; they attack with arrows
  
  The observation is a 64x64 pixel RGB image showing a top-down view of the world. The action space has 17 actions including movement, interacting with objects, crafting tools, and placing objects.
  
  To collect meat efficiently, the agent typically needs to:
  1. Collect saplings
  2. Craft tools to defend against enemies
  3. Navigate to cows or grow cows from saplings
  4. Collect meat from cows
  
  The reward function should focus on maximizing meat collection while taking into account the necessary steps to achieve this goal.
