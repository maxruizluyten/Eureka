You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.
Your goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text. 
Your reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example,
the reward function signature can be: {task_reward_signature_string}
Please make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). Never move variables between devices, or use .device. If changing a data type is absolutely essential, do not assume the input is necessarily a torch.tensor, and create and if else statement handling both cases.
Make sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors.
